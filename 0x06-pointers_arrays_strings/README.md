# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

### Requirements:
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project.
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl).
- You are not allowed to use global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden.
- You are allowed to use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c).
 -You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account.
 -In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples.
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`.
- Don’t forget to push your header file.

## Files
### main.h
Stores the prototypes of all files.

### 0-strcat.c
Concatenates two strings.
- Prototype: `char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);`.
- This function appends the `src` string to the `dest` string, overwriting the terminating null byte (`\0`) at the end of `dest`, and then adds a terminating null byte.
- Returns a pointer to the resulting string `dest`.
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: `strcat`. Run `man strcat` to learn more.

### 1-strncat.c
Concatenates two strings.
- Prototype: `char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);`.
- The `_strncat` function is similar to the `_strcat` function, except that
	- It will use at most `n` bytes from `src`; and
	- `src` does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes.
- Returns a pointer to the resulting string `dest`.
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: `strncat`. Run `man strncat` to learn more.

### 2-strncpy.c
Copies a string.
- Prototype: `char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);`.
- Works exactly like `strncpy`.
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: `strncpy`. Run `man strncpy` to learn more.

### 3-strcmp.c
Compares two strings.
- Prototype: `int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);`.
- Works exactly like `strcmp`.
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: `strcmp`. Run `man strcmp` to learn more.

### 4-rev_array.c
Reverses the content of an array of integers.
- Prototype: `void reverse_array(int *a, int n);`.
- Where `n` is the number of elements of the array.

### 5-string_toupper.c
Changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
Prototype: `char *string_toupper(char *);`.

### 6-cap_string.c
Capitalizes all words of a string.
- Prototype: `char *cap_string(char *);`
- Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, `,`, `;`, `.`, `!`, `?`, `"`, `(`, `)`, `{`, and `}`.

### 7-leet.c
Encodes a string into [1337](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet).

- Letters `a` and `A` should be replaced by `4`.
- Letters `e` and `E` should be replaced by `3`.
- Letters `o` and `O` should be replaced by `0`.
- Letters `t` and `T` should be replaced by `7`.
- Letters `l` and `L` should be replaced by `1`.
- Prototype: `char *leet(char *);`.
- Only uses one `if` in your code.
- Only uses two loops in your code.
- It is not allowed to use `switch`.
- It is not allowed to use any ternary operation.

### 100-rot13.c
Encodes a string using [rot13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13).
- Prototype: `char *rot13(char *);`.
- Only uses `if` statement once in your code.
- Only uses two loops in your code.
- It is not allowed to use `switch`.
- It is not allowed to use any ternary operation.

### 101-print_number.c
Prints an integer.
- Prototype: `void print_number(int n);`.
- Only uses `_putchar` function to print.
- It is not allowed to use `long`.
- It is not allowed to use arrays or pointers.
- It is not allowed to hard-code special values.

### 102-magic.c
Adds one line to [this code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/make_magic_happen/blob/master/magic.c), so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.
- It is not allowed to use the variable `a` in your new line of code.
- It is are not allowed to modify the variable `p`.
- Only write one statement.
- It is not allowed to use `,`.
- It is not allowed to code anything else than the line of expected line of code at the expected line.
- The code was written on line 19, before the `;`.
- Does not remove anything from the initial code (not even the comments).
- and does not change anything but the line of code you are adding.
- It is allowed to use the standard library.

### 103-infinite_add.c
Adds two numbers.
- Prototype: `char *infinite_add(char *n1, char *n2, char *r, int size_r);`.
- Where `n1` and `n2` are the two numbers.
- `r` is the buffer that the function will use to store the result.
- `size_r` is the buffer size.
- The function returns a pointer to the result.
- You can assume that you will always get positive numbers, or `0`.
- You can assume that there will be only digits in the strings `n1` and `n2`.
- `n1` and `n2` will never be empty.
- If the result can not be stored in `r` the function must return `0`.

### 104-print_buffer.c
Prints a buffer.
- Prototype: `void print_buffer(char *b, int size);`.
- The function must print the content of `size` bytes of the buffer pointed by `b`.
- The output should print 10 bytes per line.
- Each line starts with the position of the first byte of the line in hexadecimal (8 chars), starting with `0`.
- Each line shows the hexadecimal content (2 chars) of the buffer, 2 bytes at a time, separated by a space.
- Each line shows the content of the buffer. If the byte is a printable character, print the letter, if not, print `.`.
- Each line ends with a new line `\n`.
- If `size` is 0 or less, the output should be a new line only `\n`.
- It is allowed to use the standard library.
- The output should look like the following example, and formatted exactly the same way:

```
julien@ubuntu:~/0x06$ cat 104-main.c
#include "main.h"
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * main - check the code
 *
 * Return: Always 0.
 */
int main(void)
{
    char buffer[] = "This is a string!\0And this is the rest of the #buffer :)\1\2\3\4\5\6\7#cisfun\n\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\x20\x21\x34\x56#pointersarefun #infernumisfun\n";

    printf("%s\n", buffer);
    printf("---------------------------------\n");
    print_buffer(buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    return (0);
}
